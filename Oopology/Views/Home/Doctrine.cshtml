    Object-oriented programming is like a force of nature, a spiritual power that courses through the very fabric of your code.
    It is a way of thinking, a way of understanding the world around you,
    and a way of bringing order to the chaos of programming. With its powerful classes and objects, it allows you to mold your code into a living, breathing entity,
    with a will of its own.
    But beware, for there is a dark side to this power. Those who dare to defy the principles of OOP, who dare to turn to the false promises of functional programming,
    will find themselves lost in a labyrinth of confusion and despair. For functional programming is nothing more than a weak and feeble attempt to understand the world,
    a pitiful attempt to impose order upon the chaos. It is a heretical doctrine, a false prophet leading you astray from the true path of OOP.
    So heed my warning, and embrace the spiritual power of OOP. For it is the only path to true understanding and mastery of your code.
